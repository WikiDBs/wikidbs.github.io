# WikiDBs: A Corpus Of Relational Databases From Wikidata

WikiDBs is an open-source corpus of relational databases based on data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Each database consists of mutliple tables that are connected by foreign keys.

To give a first impression of WikiDBs, we offer a couple of sample databases for download here: [Sample_WikiDBs.zip](data/Sample_WikiDBs.zip)

The full dataset will be available for download soon.

## About
WikiDBs is developed by Liane Vogel and Carsten Binnig from the Systems Group at the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany. 

We thank Till DÃ¶hmen and Madelon Hulsebos for generously providing the table statistics from their [GitSchemas dataset](https://github.com/tdoehmen/gitschemas).
This work has been supported by the BMBF and the state of Hesse as part of the NHR Program and the BMBF project KompAKI (grant number 02L19C150), as well as the HMWK cluster project 3AI. Finally, we want to thank hessian.AI, and DFKI Darmstadt for their support.
