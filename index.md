# WikiDBs: A corpus of 100,000 real-world databases

WikiDBs is a large-scale corpus containing 100,000 relational databases from various domains. WikiDBs is based on data from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Each database consists of multiple tables that are connected by foreign keys. 

With WikiDBs, we aim to support the development of foundation models for tabular data and relational databases, as existing work on tabular representation learning so far mostly focuses on individual tables. 
WikiDBs contains the database schemas, as well as table contents.

## Download WikiDBs
In WikiDBs, the database tables are provided as CSV files, and each database schema as JSON. The 100,000 databases are available in five splits, containing 20k databases each. In total, around 165 GB of disk space are needed for the full corpus.

Download WikiDBs via Zenodo here: [https://zenodo.org/record/11559814](https://zenodo.org/record/11559814).

## Adapt WikiDBs to your needs
The code of WikiDBs can be found on GitHub here: [https://github.com/DataManagementLab/wikidbs-public](https://github.com/DataManagementLab/wikidbs-public)

You can adapt WikiDBs depending on your use case, e.g. by creating databases with particular data characteristics or in other languages that are included in Wikidata.

## 10k Version of WikiDBs
A preliminary version of WikiDBs ([WikiDBs 10k](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3462/TADA3.pdf)) was published at the first TaDA workshop at VLDB in 2023. 
The dataset of 10,000 databases is available via Zenodo here: [https://zenodo.org/record/8227452](https://zenodo.org/record/8227452).

To give a first impression of WikiDBs 10k, we offer a couple of sample databases for download here: [Sample_WikiDBs.zip](data/Sample_WikiDBs.zip)
