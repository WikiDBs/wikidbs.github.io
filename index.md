## About
WikiDBs is developed by Liane Vogel and Carsten Binnig from the Systems Group at the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany. 

We thank Till DÃ¶hmen and Madelon Hulsebos for generously providing the table statistics from their [GitSchemas dataset](https://github.com/tdoehmen/gitschemas) and Jan-Micha Bodensohn for converting the dataset to SQLite files.
This work has been supported by the BMBF and the state of Hesse as part of the NHR Program and the BMBF project KompAKI (grant number 02L19C150), as well as the HMWK cluster project 3AI. Finally, we want to thank hessian.AI, and DFKI Darmstadt for their support.
